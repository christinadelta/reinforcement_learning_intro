# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning 
This repo consists of a series of notebooks on Reinforcement Learning implemented with Python. It's fully inspired by the coursera [Reinforcement Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) and the introductory [RL](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018jan1.pdf) book by Sutton and Barto.
